Sam is a computer scientist and software developer living in London, working
as a full-stack developer at [EDITED](https://www.edited.com).

Out of university, he worked as a developer and data engineer at [Optimor
Labs](http://www.optimorlabs.com) -- a startup 
saving U.K. consumers and businesses money on mobile phone bills through an
advanced data-driven bill analysis and recommendation platform,
[Billmonitor](http://www.billmonitor.com).

Prior to this, he studied Computer Science (MEng) at the [University of
Southampton](https://www.southampton.ac.uk), where he took a keen interest
in many aspects of Computer Science, but developed a particular passion for
machine learning and data analysis in his final years. Outside of studies, he 
was also the Online Manager for the [Wessex
Scene](http://www.wessexscene.co.uk), Southampton University's student 
newspaper, and actively involved in a variety of student societies.

When he's not working, Sam enjoys; live music, learning guitar (very slowly), 
rock climbing, reading (about pretty much anything), and cooking (ever-more
adventurous meals).

He is also actively seeking to offer his skills and time on to social & 
environmental organisations, pro bono. Please get in touch if this 
may be of interest.
