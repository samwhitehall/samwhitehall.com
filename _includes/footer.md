Designed and developed by Sam Whitehall. 

Built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and hosted on

[take a look behind the scenes](http://www.github.com/samwhitehall/samwhitehall.com), 
but please don't plagiarise the overall design.

Header image based on a pattern by [Shankar Ganesh](http://shankar.ellipsonic.com). Icons from [Octicons](https://octicons.github.com) & [simple-icons](https://github.com/simple-icons/simple-icons). Scrollspy logic based on [Marcus Ekwall's fiddle](http://jsfiddle.net/mekwall/up4nu/).
